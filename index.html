 	<p>Hello! My name is Cody Reandeau, I graduated from Clinton Community College with an A.A.S. in Computer 
 		Technology and am currently a Computer Science student at SUNY Plattsburgh working on a B.S.. I'm very passionate about programming, and I don't see myself doing anything else besides that in my future. I've been using Java mostly for my school work and am getting really into the object-oriented style of programming. On the side, I've been teaching myself about web 
 		development and I have quickly become in love with it. I've written a couple websites (including the one your looking at now) 
 		using HTML5,CSS3,Javascript, and JQuery. I just dove into Python  as well this semester and it looks like I'm going to
 		be using it a lot this Fall. Anyways, I really appreciate you taking the time to view my website, and I encourage you
 		to check out my <a href="https://github.com/codyreandeau" target="_blank">Github</a> profile, as I am posting frequently! </p>
